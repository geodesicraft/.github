Geodesicraft is a tool for creating geodesic domes. The development is starting with the web interface which will help visualize domes and change their geometry. A plugin for Minecraft: Java Edition running on Spigot servers will be developed next. This plugin will integrate with FastAsyncWorldEdit and allow you to generate domes in-game by copy and pasting commands which you generate in the web interface.
